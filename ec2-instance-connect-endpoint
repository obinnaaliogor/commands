How to effectively utilize EC2 Instance Connect Endpoints. In this step-by-step tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating a VPC with public and private subnets, installing AWS CLI, setting up IAM policies, creating IAM users with access keys, configuring credentials, verifying OpenSSH client installation, creating security groups, setting up EC2 Instance Connect Endpoints, launching EC2 instances, connecting to them, and performing clean-up. 

1. Create a VPC with public and private subnets.

5. Create an IAM user that has an access key and secret access key, and attach the policies to the user.

6. Run the "aws configure" command to configure the IAM user's credentials on your computer.

7. Verify that the OpenSSH client is installed on your computer.
Command: ssh -V

8. Create security groups in your VPC.
- eic-endpoint-sg: Open outbound traffic on port 22 and use the VPC CIDR for the source destination.
- ec2-instance-sg: Open inbound traffic on port 22 and use the eic-endpoint-sg for the source destination.

9. Create the EC2 Instance Connect Endpoints.

10. Launch an EC2 instance in the private subnet in your VPC.

12. Connect to the instance.
Command: aws ec2-instance-connect ssh --instance-id [your-instance-id]
